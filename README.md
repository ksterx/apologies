# Apologies Pixel Art Experience

This project presents a small single-page web scene featuring a seated pixel art character.
Tapping or pressing the space/enter keys prompts the character to deliver a randomly
selected apology message in Japanese, displayed inside a floating speech bubble.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The `script.js` file draws the sprite and handles
interactions, while `styles.css` provides layout and presentation.

No build step or external dependencies are required.
